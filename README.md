# 🦅 Bird vs Drone Classification using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an AI-powered image classification system capable of distinguishing between **Birds** and **Drones** from aerial images using Deep Learning techniques.

The project compares the performance of a **Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with a **Transfer Learning MobileNetV2** model. The best-performing model is deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to upload an image and receive an instant prediction with confidence scores.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

The increasing use of drones in restricted airspaces and the presence of birds near airports, wind farms, and surveillance zones make accurate identification extremely important.

The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent computer vision system that can classify aerial images into two categories:

- 🦅 Bird
- 🚁 Drone

using Deep Learning models with high accuracy.
